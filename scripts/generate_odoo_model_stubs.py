"""Regenerate the per-version stubs of Odoo's ORM model methods.

The `OD` plugin binds call arguments against the parameter lists Odoo actually
declares, which change from one release to the next: `read_group` alone loses
`lazy`, gains `aggregates` and changes the meaning of its second positional
between 18.0 and 20.0. Rather than transcribe those signatures by hand, this
script reads them out of git revisions of odoo/odoo and writes one
signature-only Python file per version under
`crates/ruff_linter/resources/odoo/`, which the rule embeds with `include_str!`
and parses once.

Alongside each stub it writes a `removed_<version>.py`: the model methods an
earlier supported version defined and that this version no longer defines on any
class at all. That set is what `removed-odoo-method-call` reports on, and it
cannot be read off the stubs alone -- a method that merely *moved*, like
`_condition_to_sql` becoming a `Field` method in 19.0, is gone from the model
classes while `field._condition_to_sql(...)` stays a correct call. Subtracting
every other class Odoo ships keeps that distinction out of the rule.

Both are generated artifacts: regenerate them, do not hand-edit them.

    python3 scripts/generate_odoo_model_stubs.py --odoo ~/odoo/odoo

Odoo's ORM lived in `odoo/models.py` up to 18.0 and moved to the `odoo/orm/`
package in 19.0. There is no 20.0 branch yet, so its stub is cut from `master`
and the header records the exact commit it came from.
