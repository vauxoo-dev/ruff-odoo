/// ## What it does
/// Checks for a field declared more than once in the body of the same Odoo model class.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// A class body is executed top to bottom, so only the last assignment to a name survives in
/// the class `__dict__` the ORM reads. Every earlier declaration of the same field is dead:
/// its comodel, its `relation` table, its `compute` and its label never reach the registry,
/// and nothing reports that they were dropped.
///
/// The two declarations rarely agree. When they don't, the field that ends up in the
/// database is the last one, which is the opposite of what a reader scanning the class from
/// the top concludes. A `Many2many` whose dead declaration named a `relation` is the sharp
/// case: that table is never created, while the code naming it still reads as if it were.
///
/// Declaring the same field again in a *different* file or module is not this. That is Odoo
/// inheritance -- a module extending a model and overriding one of its fields -- and it is
/// the supported way to change a field. Only a name bound twice inside one class body is
/// reported, and a declaration is recognised by its `fields.<Type>(...)` call, the spelling
/// Odoo models use.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// class ResPartner(models.Model):
///     _inherit = "res.partner"
///
///     category_ids = fields.Many2many(
///         "res.partner.category.report",
///         relation="res_partner_res_partner_category_report_rel",
///     )
///     category_ids = fields.Many2many(
///         "res.partner.category",
///         relation="res_partner_res_partner_category_rel",
///     )
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// class ResPartner(models.Model):
///     _inherit = "res.partner"
///
///     category_ids = fields.Many2many(
///         "res.partner.category",
///         relation="res_partner_res_partner_category_rel",
///     )
/// ```
///
/// One diagnostic is reported per duplicated field, anchored on its first declaration and
/// listing every other one, so a field declared three times reads as a single finding rather
/// than as two. Removing the declarations that have no effect is the mechanically correct
/// edit: the last one is what the ORM already read and what the database follows, so dropping
/// the others cannot change how the code runs. No fix is offered even so. The duplicate is
/// normally an accident, which means the surviving declaration is not necessarily the one
/// anybody chose, and applying the edit automatically would settle that question without
/// anybody looking at it.
