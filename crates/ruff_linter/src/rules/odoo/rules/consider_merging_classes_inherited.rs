/// ## What it does
/// Checks for multiple Odoo model extension classes in the same module that use
/// the same `_inherit` model name.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Splitting the extension of a single Odoo model across several classes in the
/// same module makes the module harder to read and maintain. In most cases, the
/// classes can be merged into one extension class for that inherited model.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// class ResPartnerA(models.Model):
///     _inherit = "res.partner"
///
///
/// class ResPartnerB(models.Model):
///     _inherit = "res.partner"
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// class ResPartner(models.Model):
///     _inherit = "res.partner"
/// ```
