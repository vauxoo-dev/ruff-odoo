/// ## What it does
/// Checks for calls to ORM methods Odoo has deprecated, according to the configured
/// [`odoo-version`](../settings.md#lint_odoo_odoo-version).
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// A deprecated method raises a `DeprecationWarning` at runtime and will eventually be
/// removed. Most of the replacements are not drop-in — signatures, return types, and in the
/// case of `_check_recursion` even the sense of the returned boolean differ — so the call
/// sites have to be reviewed by hand.
///
/// Odoo dropped most of these after 19.0, so on a version at or past the removal the message
/// says the call raises `AttributeError` rather than warning.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// groups = self.read_group(domain, ["amount:sum"], ["partner_id"])
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// groups = self._read_group(domain, ["partner_id"], ["amount:sum"])
/// ```
