/// ## What it does
/// Checks for the `depends` key of an Odoo module's `__manifest__.py` listing its modules
/// in an order other than alphabetical.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Odoo resolves the dependency graph itself, so the order of `depends` carries no
/// meaning: it is purely a reading aid. Keeping the list alphabetical makes a module easy
/// to look up by eye, and keeps merge conflicts down — two branches adding a dependency
/// both append to the end of an unsorted list and collide on the same line, while a sorted
/// list spreads the additions out.
///
/// Entries are ordered lexicographically, the order Python's own `sorted()` gives, so
/// `sale_stock` comes before `salemodule`.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// {
///     "depends": [
///         "sale",
///         # needed for the analytic distribution widget
///         "account",
///         "base",
///     ],
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// {
///     "depends": [
///         # needed for the analytic distribution widget
///         "account",
///         "base",
///         "sale",
///     ],
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Fix safety
/// A list written across several lines is rewritten one entry per line, always with a
/// trailing comma, whatever layout it had before. A comment written on its own line above
/// an entry travels with that entry, and so does a comment trailing it on the same line;
/// no comment is ever dropped. A list written entirely on one line is only reordered — its
/// layout and its lack of a trailing comma are left alone.
///
/// Note that a comment introducing a *group* of entries moves with the single entry right
/// below it, which is rarely what a group header means — review the fix when the list is
/// organized in commented sections.
///
/// No fix is offered when the list cannot be rewritten without guessing:
/// - a blank line groups the entries, and reordering across it would scramble the grouping;
/// - a line holds several entries *and* a trailing comment, so there is no telling which
///   entry the comment belongs to;
/// - an entry spans more than one line (implicit concatenation).
