/// ## Deprecation
/// This rule is deprecated in favor of [`try-except-pass`][S110], which reports the exact
/// same code: an `except` handler whose whole body is a `pass`. The rule was ported from
/// pylint-odoo's `except-pass` before that overlap was noticed, and keeping both meant the
/// same handler was reported twice, once per rule.
///
/// [S110]: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/try-except-pass/
///
/// ## What it does
/// Checks for `except` blocks whose entire body is a bare `pass`.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Silently swallowing an exception without at least logging it makes bugs
/// hard to diagnose. If the exception is genuinely expected and ignorable,
/// prefer `contextlib.suppress`, which documents that intent; otherwise, log
/// the exception.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// try:
///     do_something()
/// except Exception:
///     pass
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// try:
///     do_something()
/// except Exception:
///     _logger.exception("do_something failed")
/// ```
