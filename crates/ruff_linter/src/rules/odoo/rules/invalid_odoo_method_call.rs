/// ## What it does
/// Checks calls to Odoo ORM model methods against the parameter list the method actually
/// has in the configured [`odoo-version`](../settings.md#lint_odoo_odoo-version).
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Odoo reshapes ORM signatures between releases, and the call sites do not fail until the
/// line runs. `read_group` is the extreme case: 20.0 reused the freed name for a different
/// method, so `self.read_group(domain, fields, groupby, lazy=False)` raises
/// `TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument 'lazy'` there while reading as valid code.
/// The same happens more quietly elsewhere — `_search` dropped `access_rights_uid` in 18.0,
/// `name_search` renamed `args` to `domain` in 19.0 — and a migration has no way to find
/// them short of running every branch.
///
/// The check needs signatures to compare against, so it reports nothing unless `odoo-version`
/// is set to a version this linter ships a stub for. Since that silence is indistinguishable
/// from a clean run, it warns once on stderr when the setting is missing or names a version
/// with no signatures; the run still succeeds, and the warning only appears when this rule is
/// enabled.
///
/// Only receivers that are certainly recordsets are checked: `self` and `super()` inside a
/// model class, `env[...]` subscripts anywhere, and chains of recordset-returning ORM calls
/// over either, so `self.env["res.partner"].sudo().search(...)` is covered. A local is not,
/// because nothing distinguishes one holding a recordset from one holding a worksheet. A
/// method the file defines itself is left alone too, since the call may well mean that
/// override rather than Odoo's -- except through `env["other.model"]`, which reaches a model
/// the override says nothing about.
///
/// ## Known limitation
/// The check binds arguments; it does not know that a name changed meaning. Where Odoo
/// reused a freed name for a method of the same arity, a fully positional call still binds
/// and is not reported, even though every argument now lands on a different parameter:
///
/// ```python
/// # Silent on 20.0: seven positionals against a signature that takes seven.
/// super().read_group(domain, fields, groupby, offset, limit, orderby, lazy)
/// ```
///
/// Nothing in that call distinguishes it from correct 20.0 code, so reporting it would land
/// on code that is right. Naming a repurposed method is
/// [`deprecated-odoo-method-call`](deprecated-odoo-method-call.md)'s job, not this one's.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// groups = self.read_group(domain, ["amount:sum"], ["partner_id"], lazy=False)
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// groups = self._read_group(domain, ["partner_id"], ["amount:sum"])
/// ```
// Not in a default category: without `lint.odoo.odoo-version` the rule only warns that it is
// skipping itself, which `--preview` would otherwise print on every project, Odoo or not.
