/// ## What it does
/// Checks for calls to ORM model methods that no longer exist in the configured
/// [`odoo-version`](../settings.md#lint_odoo_odoo-version).
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Odoo deletes model methods between releases, most of them without a deprecation cycle:
/// `name_get`, `user_has_groups` and `copy_multi` went in 18.0, `_where_calc`,
/// `clear_caches` and `_apply_ir_rules` in 19.0. The call sites keep reading as valid Python
/// and raise `AttributeError` the first time the line runs, which on a portal controller or
/// a report means the branch nobody exercised during the migration.
///
/// Nothing else finds these. [`deprecated-odoo-method-call`](deprecated-odoo-method-call.md)
/// only knows the handful of methods Odoo marked `@api.deprecated`, and
/// [`invalid-odoo-method-call`](invalid-odoo-method-call.md) binds arguments against a
/// signature, so it goes quiet on exactly the methods that no longer have one.
///
/// The removal set is generated from Odoo's own source by
/// `scripts/generate_odoo_model_stubs.py`, which subtracts every name Odoo still defines
/// on some class before calling a method gone. That is what keeps two shapes out of it: a
/// method that moved, like `_condition_to_sql` leaving `BaseModel` for `Field` in 19.0, and
/// a name too ordinary to judge from the name alone, like `refresh`, which the ORM dropped
/// in 17.0 and a hardware driver's browser still answers to.
///
/// The check needs a removal set to look in, so it reports nothing unless `odoo-version` is
/// set to a version this linter ships one for. Since that silence is indistinguishable from
/// a clean run, it warns once on stderr when the setting is missing or names a version with
/// no set; the run still succeeds, and the warning only appears when this rule is enabled.
///
/// ## Scope
/// Any receiver counts, inside any class that inherits something which is not a Python
/// builtin. Unlike the argument-binding rules there is no need to prove the receiver is a
/// recordset: these names no longer exist anywhere in Odoo, so a call to one is either an
/// ORM call that breaks or a name the project defined itself, and the second is checked
/// for. That is what reaches the shape the migrations actually leave behind, a model looked
/// up into a local:
///
/// ```python
/// sale_obj = request.env["sale.order"]
/// query = sale_obj._where_calc(domain)
/// ```
///
/// A class that defines the method itself keeps its call, since the call means that
/// definition rather than Odoo's. A class inheriting only `object`, `Exception` or another
/// builtin is left alone: it is Python, not Odoo.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// class SaleOrder(models.Model):
///     _inherit = "sale.order"
///
///     def matching(self, domain):
///         return self._where_calc(domain)
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// class SaleOrder(models.Model):
///     _inherit = "sale.order"
///
///     def matching(self, domain):
///         return self._search(domain)
/// ```
// Not in a default category: without `lint.odoo.odoo-version` the rule only warns that it is
// skipping itself, which `--preview` would otherwise print on every project, Odoo or not.
