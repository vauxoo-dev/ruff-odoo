/// ## What it does
/// Checks for calls to the bare `_()`/`_lt()` translation functions.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Since Odoo 18.0, `self.env._()` is preferred over the bare `_()`/`_lt()` functions.
///
/// The rule only applies from Odoo 18.0 on: `self.env._` does not exist in earlier versions,
/// so on an older codebase the bare `_()` is the only correct call. Configure the targeted
/// version with the `odoo-version` setting; without it the rule stays enabled.
///
/// Inside an `http.Controller` the rule instead applies from Odoo 19.0 on, the version that
/// gave `Controller` its `env` property. On 18.0 a controller reaches the environment through
/// `request.env` alone, so there is no `self.env._` to recommend and the call is not reported
/// at all — reporting it would name a replacement that does not exist on that version.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// def my_method(self):
///     return _("Hello")
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// def my_method(self):
///     return self.env._("Hello")
/// ```
///
/// ## Fix safety
/// The rewrite is only offered where `self.env` exists: inside a method of an Odoo model or
/// of an `http.Controller`. At module level, in a plain function, in a `@staticmethod`, in a
/// nested function or in a class that is not Odoo's, the call is reported without a fix,
/// since `self.env` would resolve to nothing there.
///
/// The same goes for what the call resolves to: only `odoo._`/`odoo._lt` are rewritten,
/// which covers an aliased import (`from odoo import _ as lt`) and leaves a `_` that came
/// from `gettext`, or a local of that name, reported but untouched.
///
/// In the code of a cron or server action, written in an Odoo XML data file, the environment
/// is `env` rather than `self.env`, so the message names `env._` instead.
