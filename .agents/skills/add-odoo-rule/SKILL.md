# Add a custom Odoo rule to this ruff fork

Context: this fork adds a Vauxoo-specific `OD` rule plugin to Ruff, porting checks from
`pylint-odoo` and OCA's `odoo-pre-commit-hooks` so they run natively in Ruff with real autofix.
The rule group already exists (`crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/odoo/`, prefix `OD`, registered as
`Linter::Odoo` in `registry.rs`) — this skill is for adding one more rule to it, not for the
one-time plugin scaffold (that was done via `scripts/add_plugin.py odoo --url ... --prefix OD`;
only redo that if the `odoo` plugin directory has somehow been removed).

## Scope discipline — read this before starting

Only port **single-file, pure-Python-AST checks**. Explicitly out of scope for this plugin:
- Checks needing cross-file/whole-project aggregation (e.g. pylint-odoo's
  `consider-merging-classes-inherited`).
- Checks on non-Python files: XML views, CSV access rights, PO/gettext files. Ruff has no lint
  pipeline for these today (`ruff_linter` only walks `.py`/`.pyi`/`pyproject.toml`) — building one
  is a large, separate architectural project, not a "new rule".
- Manifest/directory-tree correlation checks (e.g. `file-not-used`,
  `weblate-component-too-long`).

Those stay covered by the existing `pylint-odoo` / `odoo-pre-commit-hooks` pre-commit hooks,
unchanged, running alongside this Ruff plugin. If a request doesn't fit "single Python file, AST
in, diagnostic (+ optionally an Edit-based fix) out", stop and flag it instead of forcing it in.

## Before writing code: find the real spec

Read the actual source of the check being ported before writing anything:
- pylint-odoo: `checkers/odoo_addons.py` (or `custom_logging.py` / `vim_comment.py`) in the
  `pylint-odoo` checkout — grep for the message code (e.g. `W8106`) to find the exact
  `visit_*`/`add_message` logic and any default config lists (e.g.
  `DFTL_METHOD_REQUIRED_SUPER`).
- odoo-pre-commit-hooks: `src/oca_pre_commit_hooks/checks_odoo_module_fixit_rules/<name>.py` — the
  `VALID`/`INVALID` test case lists at the bottom of each file are the clearest spec of intended
  behavior and good source material for the Ruff fixture file.

Port the *behavior*, not the *implementation* — pylint-odoo uses astroid inference
(`safe_infer`, `node.lookup`) that Ruff doesn't have; approximate with Ruff's semantic/binding
model (`checker.semantic()`) for same-file scope questions (e.g. "is this class an Odoo model" via
`ScopeKind::Class` + checking base class names), and simplify or skip anything that genuinely needs
cross-module inference (see Scope discipline above).

## Per-rule checklist

1. **Rule file** — `crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/odoo/rules/<rule_name>.rs`:
   - `#[derive(ViolationMetadata)] pub(crate) struct RuleName { ... }`, annotated with
     `#[violation_metadata(preview_since = "<next fork version>", category = Category::X)]`.
     The category is required (the build fails without it) and follows the letter of the
     code: `E`/`F` → `Correctness`, `W` → `Suspicious`, `C` → `Style`, `R` → `Complexity`,
     `OAPP` → `Style`; a security check takes `Security` whatever its letter, and a rule that
     does nothing until a setting is configured (`invalid-odoo-method-call`,
     `removed-odoo-method-call` need `lint.odoo.odoo-version`) takes `Restriction`. With
     `preview = true` and no explicit `select`, Ruff enables the `correctness`, `suspicious`,
     `complexity`, `performance` and `style` categories by default, so the category also
     decides whether the rule is on out of the box; `settings::tests::preview_default_rules`
     lists every rule that is, and must be updated with the new one.
   - `impl Violation for RuleName` (or `AlwaysFixableViolation` if the fix is unconditional) with
     `message()`, and `fix_title()` if fixable. Set `const FIX_AVAILABILITY` to `Sometimes` when
     the fix isn't always offered (e.g. only for standalone-line comments, not inline ones).
   - The analysis function, doc-commented with `## What it does` / `## Why is this bad?` /
     `## Example` (with a "Use instead" counter-example) — these sections feed
     `cargo dev generate-all`'s doc generation, so keep them accurate; a malformed docstring won't
     necessarily fail the build but will produce a broken `docs/rules/<name>.md`.
   - For autofix: build the diagnostic with `checker.report_diagnostic(...)`, then
     `.try_set_fix(|| edit_fn().map(Fix::safe_edit))` (or `.set_fix(...)` directly when the fix
     can't fail). Reuse existing helpers before writing new ones:
     - `crate::fix::edits::remove_argument` — removes a positional or keyword call argument,
       comma-aware. Works for both `&Expr` and `&ast::Keyword` (it's generic over `T: Ranged`).
     - `crate::fix::edits::delete_stmt` — deletes a whole statement, handling trailing semicolons,
       lone-child-of-block (`pass` substitution), and full-line cleanup.
     - For dict-literal key/value pair removal (no existing generic helper) — see
       `crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/odoo/helpers.rs::remove_dict_item` for a worked
       comma-aware implementation to copy the pattern from (handles "not last item", "last item",
       and "only item — also eat a trailing comma if present" as three distinct cases).
   - **Autofixes must respect the configured line length.** A fix that rewrites/lengthens source
     (collapsing a multiline string, splicing `%(name)s` placeholders, adding keyword args) can
     leave a line over `line-length`, so the "fixed" code immediately trips E501/B950 downstream.
     Measure the rewritten line first with `crate::fix::edits::fits` — including what surrounds
     the replaced range on its line (prefix is measured by `fits`; append the suffix up to
     `locator.line_end(range.end())` yourself, plus any trailing comma the context adds) — and
     keep the simple in-place rewrite when it fits. When it doesn't:
     - a long string value wraps into a parenthesized implicit concatenation via
       `rules/odoo/helpers.rs::wrap_string_literal` (splits only right after spaces so the
       concatenated pieces reproduce the content *exactly*, `\n` escapes included; each non-final
       piece keeps its trailing space — dropping it glues words together);
     - a long call rewrite expands over `call.arguments.range()` with one argument per line and a
       **trailing comma** (magic trailing comma keeps `ruff format` from re-collapsing it),
       closing paren at the indentation of the call's line.
     Worked examples: `manifest_summary_multiline.rs` (ODC8120) and
     `translation_calls.rs::convert_to_named_placeholders` (ODW8120). Indentation comes from
     `locator.line_start` + leading whitespace and `checker.stylist().indentation()`; when
     there's no usable indentation (inline dict, key not starting its own line), fall back to
     the single-line fix rather than guessing. Add fixture cases for both the fits-in-one-line
     and the must-wrap paths (test default line length is 88).
2. **`rules/odoo/rules/mod.rs`** — add `pub(crate) use <rule_name>::*;` and `mod <rule_name>;`
   (both lists are alphabetically ordered by convention).
3. **Dispatch site** — wire the call behind `checker.is_rule_enabled(Rule::RuleName)`, in whichever
   file matches what the rule inspects:
   - `checkers/ast/analyze/expression.rs` — for `Expr::*` node checks (e.g. `Expr::Dict` for
     manifest checks). Add `odoo` to the `use crate::rules::{...}` import list (alphabetical).
   - `checkers/ast/analyze/statement.rs` — for `Stmt::*` node checks (e.g. `Stmt::Try` for
     except-pass, `Stmt::FunctionDef` for method checks, `Stmt::Assign` for field checks). Same
     import-list convention.
   - `checkers/ast/analyze/module.rs` — for whole-module checks that need to see the full `Suite`
     at once (e.g. "is this module-level `_logger` binding ever used anywhere in the file" —
     can't be answered from a single-node visitor, needs the full body via
     `ruff_python_ast::helpers::any_over_body`).
   - `checkers/tokens.rs` — for comment/token-stream checks (e.g. vim modelines). Loop over
     `comment_ranges` like the neighboring `ambiguous_unicode_character_comment` call does.
4. **`codes.rs`** — one line in the `// odoo` block:
   `(Odoo, "X8NNN") => rules::odoo::rules::RuleName,`, keeping the block sorted.
   The code is **not** a new sequential number: it is the id the check already has in the
   tool it came from, with its category letter, so `E8103 sql-injection` in pylint-odoo is
   `(Odoo, "E8103")` here and renders as `ODE8103`. Two cases:
   - **Ported from pylint-odoo** — reuse its code verbatim. Find it in that project's
     `ODOO_MSGS` (or in the `MESSAGE_ALIASES` table in `pylint_disable_comment.rs`, which
     lists every one of them).
   - **Ported from odoo-pre-commit-hooks** — there is no original code, so take the next
     free number in the `85xx` block, under the letter that matches the check's category
     (`C` convention, `E` error, `F` fatal, `R` refactor, `W` warning).
   - **Invented here** — take the next free number in the `95xx` block, same letters. It is
     a block of its own so that `85xx` stays available for whatever else comes from the two
     upstream projects: a check ported later should land next to its siblings rather than
     wherever a fork-only rule happened to leave a gap.

   Never invent a number outside `85xx`/`95xx`: pylint-odoo may later claim anything below.
   Picking the letter is a judgement call — `E` for what breaks or is certainly wrong (data,
   security, a call that raises), `W` for a construct that runs but is almost certainly a
   mistake, `C` for convention, `R` for a refactor. When in doubt, look at where the closest
   existing rule sits: the field-definition checks (`renamed-field-parameter` `ODW8111`,
   `attribute-string-redundant` `ODW8113`, `m2m-relation-is-label` `ODW9501`) are all `W`.
5. **⚠️ The gotcha that costs the most debugging time**: if the rule is dispatched from
   `checkers/tokens.rs` (or `checkers/physical_lines.rs` / `checkers/filesystem.rs`), it is **not
   enough** to wire the dispatch call — you must also add the rule to the matching arm of
   `Rule::lint_source()` in `registry.rs` (e.g. `| Rule::RuleName => LintSource::Tokens,`).
   Without this, `linter.rs`'s `context.iter_enabled_rules().any(|r| r.lint_source().is_tokens())`
   gate stays false, `check_tokens` never even runs, and the rule silently produces zero
   diagnostics — it compiles fine and the mistake is easy to miss. AST-dispatched rules (from
   `expression.rs`/`statement.rs`/`module.rs`) don't need this — they fall into the `_ =>
   LintSource::Ast` catch-all automatically.
6. **Naming convention** — rule struct names must read as "allow `${RuleName}`" (Clippy-style).
   `crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/disallowed_rule_names.txt` bans names starting with `use-`,
   `avoid-`, `prefer-`, `consider-`, etc. (checked by the `rule_naming_convention` test) — e.g. use
   `VimComment`, not `UseVimComment`, even if the original pylint-odoo message said "Use of vim
   comment" (that phrasing is fine for the `message()` string, just not the struct/code name).

   The **module file** is named after the check it holds, in `snake_case`, and a module holding a
   family of related checks is named after the family. Keep siblings in the same shape — same word
   order, same singular/plural — so the pair reads as a pair: `deprecated_odoo_method_call.rs`
   (the call site) alongside `deprecated_odoo_method_name.rs` (the definition), not
   `deprecated_method_names.rs`. A module name that does not pair with its sibling is a wart
   every later reader has to decode, so get it right on the first commit.

   The module file name is *not* what a commit message uses as its target: that is the rule
   name in `kebab-case`, which is the same words with dashes when a module holds one check,
   and something else entirely when it holds a family. See
   [Commit messages](#commit-messages).
7. **Registry ordering** — `Linter::Odoo` in `registry.rs`'s `Linter` enum must stay alphabetically
   positioned by its doc-comment name (`odoo`, between `NumPy-specific rules` and
   `[pandas-vet](...)`) — checked by the `linter_sorting` test. If a rebase moves things around,
   re-sort rather than appending at the end.
8. **Test fixture + case**:
   - `crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/fixtures/odoo/rule_name.py`, named after the rule in
     snake_case rather than after its code (or `rule_name/__manifest__.py` for
     manifest-file-gated rules — the file must literally be named `__manifest__.py` since
     those rules check `checker.path().file_name()`; see `crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/fixtures/odoo/manifest_required_key/`
     for the pattern of nesting a directory to get a specific filename, mirroring how
     `pep8_naming`'s `N999` tests do `Path::new("N999/module/flake9/__init__.py")`).
   - One `#[test_case(Rule::RuleName, Path::new("rule_name.py"))]` per fixture in
     `crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/odoo/mod.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block, using
     `crate::assert_diagnostics` + `LinterSettings::for_rule` (this is the current convention —
     don't copy `scripts/add_plugin.py`'s generated test scaffold verbatim, it uses stale
     `assert_messages!`/`.as_ref()` APIs that no longer exist; check a recent plugin's `mod.rs`,
     e.g. `flake8_bugbear/mod.rs`, for the live pattern).
   - Write the fixture to exercise both the positive case(s) and the near-miss negative cases from
     the original tool's own `VALID`/`INVALID` test lists (skip cases that only exercise the
     cross-file/non-Python scope this plugin deliberately excludes).
   - Run the standard test command from `AGENTS.md` scoped to the crate (or `cargo test -p
     ruff_linter --lib rules::odoo` as a fast fallback when `nextest` isn't installed), then
     **review** the generated/updated `.snap` files under `rules/odoo/snapshots/` — count the
     diagnostics and check the fix output by hand, don't just trust a green test run.

## Verification (run all of these before considering a rule done)

1. `cargo check --workspace` — not just `-p ruff_linter`; the `Linter` enum and rule registry are
   referenced from other crates.
2. The full `ruff_linter` test suite (not just the new rule's test) — a bad edit to a shared
   dispatch file can silently break unrelated rules:
   ```
   CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_OPT_LEVEL=1 CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_LTO=off INSTA_FORCE_PASS=1 INSTA_UPDATE=always CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG="line-tables-only" cargo nextest run -p ruff_linter
   ```
   (fallback: `cargo test -p ruff_linter --lib`). Pay attention to
   `registry::tests::rule_naming_convention` and `registry::tests::linter_sorting` specifically.

   > [!WARNING]
   > A filtered run (`cargo test -p ruff_linter --lib rules::odoo`) reports something like
   > "125 passed; 2817 filtered out". Those 2817 are **not** green — they never ran. Never
   > report a filtered run as if the suite were passing, and never push on the strength of one.

3. **If you added a field to `odoo::settings::Settings`** — run `cargo test --workspace`, not
   just `-p ruff_linter`. The `Settings` `Display` impl is serialized verbatim into the CLI
   snapshots of a *different* crate, so a new field breaks ~12 snapshots under
   `crates/ruff/tests/cli/snapshots/` (`cli__show_settings__*` and every
   `cli__lint__requires_python_*`). They are invisible to `-p ruff_linter`, to `cargo clippy`
   and to `cargo fmt`, so the first sign of trouble is `cargo test (linux/macos/windows)`
   turning red in CI — all three at once — after everything looked green locally. Find them
   with a field name already in `Settings`:
   ```
   grep -rl "deprecated_odoo_model_methods" crates/ruff crates/ruff_workspace
   ```
   Regenerate with `INSTA_UPDATE=always cargo test --workspace` (or `cargo insta accept`), then
   **review the diff**: it must be exactly one added line per snapshot, nothing else. Remember
   the three places a new option has to be wired — the `Settings` struct *and* its
   `display_settings!` block in `rules/odoo/settings.rs`, the `OdooOptions` field plus its
   `to_settings` arm in `crates/ruff_workspace/src/options.rs`, and `ruff.schema.json` via
   `generate-all`.
4. `cargo dev generate-all` — regenerates `ruff.schema.json` and `docs/rules/<name>.md` (the
   latter is gitignored, generated on demand — its successful generation without errors is itself
   a useful smoke test that the doc comment sections are well-formed). **If you touched a
   `Linter` enum variant's doc comment** (adding a new sub-linter like `OdooApp`/`OAPP`, or editing
   `Linter::Odoo`'s own doc link) — `generate-all` runs `cargo dev generate-rules-table`, which
   panics if that variant's `/// [name](url)` doc comment doesn't resolve to a `pypi.org` or
   `github.com` host (`crates/ruff_dev/src/generate_rules_table.rs`'s `linter.url()` check). This
   is exactly the mkdocs CI job's "Generate docs" step, so a URL pointing anywhere else (e.g. a
   vendor site like `apps.odoo.com`) passes `cargo check`/tests locally but only fails in that CI
   job — run `cargo dev generate-rules-table` locally after any `Linter` doc-comment change to
   catch it before pushing. If there's no natural pypi.org package to link, point at the rule
   group's own source directory on GitHub instead (e.g.
   `https://github.com/Vauxoo/ruff-odoo/tree/main/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/<group>`).
5. **Doc-example formatting** — CI's mkdocs job runs every ```` ```python ```` example in the rule
   docs through `ruff format` and fails on any diff (`scripts/check_docs_formatted.py`). Common
   traps: a "Use instead" empty dict must be `{}` (not a multi-line `{\n}`), stub bodies must
   collapse to `def f(): ...` (not `...` on its own indented line), and lines over the format
   width must be wrapped the way `ruff format` would wrap them. Validate locally after
   `generate-all` — the script checks the *generated* `docs/rules/*.md`, not the `.rs` files, so
   regenerate first — and put the freshly built binary on `PATH` (the script shells out to
   whatever `ruff` it finds):
   ```
   PATH="$PWD/target/debug:$PATH" python3 scripts/check_docs_formatted.py
   ```
   Expect "All docs are formatted correctly." On failure it prints the exact `///` rewrite to
   paste into the rule file. It takes a few minutes (one `ruff format` subprocess per snippet
   across all ~900 rules), so run it in the background.

   The same job then builds the `OD`/`OAPP` documentation site, which is where a broken link
   or a missing anchor in a doc comment turns into an error. Build it after
   `cargo dev generate-odoo-docs`, with the pinned dependency set CI installs — `mkdocs` is
   not a development dependency of this checkout, so a bare `mkdocs` is "command not found"
   and `uv run --only-group dev` does not provide it either:
   ```
   uv run --no-project --with-requirements docs/requirements.txt mkdocs build --strict -f mkdocs-odoo.yml
   ```
   `--no-project` is what keeps `uv run` from building Ruff from source first, and `--strict`
   is the whole point of running it. Expect it to end with "Documentation built in …".
6. `cargo fmt` (verify with `cargo fmt --check`) — CI has a dedicated formatting job that fails
   on any diff, and hand-written fix-building code (long `Edit::range_replacement(...)` calls,
   nested builders) frequently comes out slightly off rustfmt style. Run it before every push,
   not just before the first one.
7. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
8. `uv run --only-group dev --locked prek run --files <every file touched>` (or `uvx prek run
   --files ...` if this checkout has no `uv.lock` for `--locked` to resolve against — batch the
   file list in groups of ~5-10; a single `--files` call with 30+ paths has failed here with
   "File name too long").
9. Manual smoke test with the built binary, including `--fix`, on a small synthetic Odoo module —
   don't rely on unit tests alone to validate the CLI-level experience:
   ```
   cargo build --bin ruff
   target/debug/ruff check --select OD --preview --no-cache --fix <path>
   ```
10. Coverage (optional but useful when adding a non-trivial rule):
   `cargo llvm-cov -p ruff_linter --lib --summary-only -- rules::odoo` (install once with `cargo
   install cargo-llvm-cov --locked` + `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`), then grep the
   `rules/odoo/` lines from the output.

## Commit messages

The `target` names the check(s) the commit works on, spelled as the **rule name in
`kebab-case`** — the name Ruff itself reports, the one `ruff rule` prints, the one in the
`ODE9503 (removed-odoo-method-call)` form the diagnostics use, and the one
`docs/rules/<name>.md` is generated under. It is *not* the module file's `snake_case`
spelling. Several checks in one commit means several targets, comma-separated:

```
[IMP] deprecated-odoo-method-call, deprecated-odoo-method-name: track the removal of the access methods Odoo dropped in 20.0
[IMP] no-search-all: extend the list of models known to grow
[FIX] prefer-env-translation: align the check with its fix in controllers
```

> [!WARNING]
> The log currently holds both spellings, because this section used to ask for
> `snake_case`: `[ADD] invalid-odoo-method-call` (#68) and `[ADD] manifest-depends-unsorted`
> (#59) next to `[ADD] removed_odoo_method_call` (#69) and
> `[IMP] deprecated_odoo_method_call, deprecated_odoo_method_name` (#56). Kebab-case is the
> one to use from now on. Do not "fix" the older commits; just stop adding to the pile.

Where a module holds a family of checks, the target is the rule name of the check that
changed, not the family's module name. A commit touching two rules that live in one file
still names both rules.

A bare `odoo:` target is only for a change that belongs to no particular check — the plugin
scaffold, a shared helper in `rules/odoo/helpers.rs`, the `Settings` struct, the registry wiring.
Reaching for `odoo:` because the commit happens to touch two rule files is exactly what this rule
exists to prevent: from the log alone the reader cannot tell which checks changed behaviour, and
that is the one thing they need when a `pre-commit-vauxoo` bump suddenly starts reporting
something new across every project.

The rest of the format is the Odoo standard (`[TAG] target: summary`) covered by the
`odoo-commit-message-guidelines` skill — this section only settles what `target` is in this repo.
The PR title carries the same target as the commit it squashes.

## Before opening a PR

The working branch is very likely behind `astral/main` (Ruff moves fast). Run the
`sync-astral-upstream` skill first to rebase and resolve conflicts, re-verify, and only then hand
off to the `create-pr-mr` skill: push to `dev` (`Vauxoo-dev/ruff`), open the PR against `stb`
(`Vauxoo/ruff`) — never against `astral`.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Port a simple detection-only pylint-odoo check

**User:** Add the except-pass rule from pylint-odoo (W8138).
**Action:** The agent reads `odoo_addons.py`'s `visit_try`, writes
`rules/odoo/rules/except_pass.rs` dispatched from `statement.rs`'s `Stmt::Try` arm, adds the
`codes.rs` entry, writes a fixture covering flagged/unflagged cases, runs the full verification
list, and reports the result — no `registry.rs` `lint_source` change needed since it's AST-based.

### Example 2: Port an autofixable odoo-pre-commit-hooks check

**User:** Port the unused-logger check with autofix.
**Action:** The agent reads the LibCST rule's `VALID`/`INVALID` cases, writes a whole-module check
dispatched from `analyze/module.rs` using `any_over_body` to detect usage, wires an
`AlwaysFixableViolation` fix via `fix::edits::delete_stmt`, and verifies with both the unit test
snapshot and a manual `--fix` smoke test.
